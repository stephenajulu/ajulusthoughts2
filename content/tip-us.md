**Note: this is only for editorial tips. For advertising** [**go here**](/advertise-here)**, for technical support** [**go here**](/support)**, and for other inquiries** [**go here**](https://thenoesis12.netlify.app/contact)**.**

Some of our most important stories could start with tips. We’re always looking for information about the companies and products that shape the way we live, insight into the government agencies responsible for tech, cybersecurity and the environment, and other stories about the impact technology has on human beings. Evidence is key: firsthand experience or revealing documents will be more useful than a hunch. Have you encountered something that the public should know about? If so, we want to hear from you.

## How to tip TechWit Ke

### **Email**

Email is the easiest way to reach us. Send tips to the secure TechWit Ke's email here: [thenoesis.ke@protonmail.com](thenoesis.ke@protonmail.com)

Email addresses for specific writers and editors will be available to [the staff list](http://thenoesis12.netlify.app/about).

If you are at risk of reprisals, do not use your work email, Wi-Fi, or device.

### **Signal**

You can also send tips using the app [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/), which encrypts text messages and calls. Signal stores your number and the last time you accessed the app, but not whom you communicate with. Be sure not to use your work phone. You can download [Signal here](https://whispersystems.org).

You can tip _The Noesis_ via Signal here: +254 726 024 210

Depending on what version of Signal you’re using, you may need to add _The Noessis Ke’s_ number as a contact before beginning a conversation. The contact can be deleted once the conversation has begun.
