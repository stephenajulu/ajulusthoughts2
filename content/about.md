### About Me

##### Hi there! My name is Stephen Ajulu.

##### I am a content creator, web developer, graphic designer and consultant.

##### I also build, represent, grow and sell brands at [StephenAjulu.com/Brands](https://stephenajulu.com/brands)

#### What I'm Working On

1. 👨🏼‍⚕️ Studying I.T in Kenya.
2. ✏ Creating content, currently writing [here](https://ajulusthoughts.stephenajulu.com), posting videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC043ZXL-t3yqtgcIxJmkHuA?view_as=subscriber), writing newsletters(subscribe below), [podcasting](https://anchor.fm/stephenajulu) and syndicating everywhere else([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stephenajulu), [Medium](https://medium.com/@stephenajulu), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenajulu/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stephenajulu), [Devto](https://dev.to/stephenajulu) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stephenajulu)).
3. 💼I freelance(currently working to start my own agency).
4.  🏛 My projects: Biomme(BioEmergency), The Bistro Ke Newsletter, SAOA inc, T.H.I.S , My own personal shop, my brand, this blog and Tech6
5. ✍️ On this website I write articles about [productivity](https://aliabdaal.com/tag/productivity/), [entrepreneurship](https://aliabdaal.com/entrepreneurship/) and [generic life advice](https://aliabdaal.com/tag/life/) that I've found helpful over the years, as well as sharing my [favourites apps](https://aliabdaal.com/apps/) and [tech](https://aliabdaal.com/tech/).

#### Get in Touch

1. **🐦** [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/stephenajulu) - If you've got a short question or message (<280 characters), please tweet [@StephenAjulu](https://twitter.com/stephenajulu) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I also occasionally reply to [Instagram DMs](https://instagram.com/stephenajulu) but it's much more cumbersome to do so (for now).
2. **📨** [**Email**](mailto:hi@aliabdaal.com) - If it's a longer thing, or you don't want it to be a public tweet, please email me (ajulu@stephenajulu.com). I read 100% of emails but there's only enough time in the day to reply to around 30%. If you reply to my [weekly newsletter](https://email.stephenajulu.com/) with a specific question, the chances I'll reply are much higher, as I like to spend Sundays doing chill stuff like replying to emails.
