Do you have an idea? Don't know programming? Do you want to test it? Today i answer all these questions and help you build your minimal viable product of your idea and test it's performance in the actual market for FREE!

Yes, you heard me, free. Whether it's an app or a website, whether you know how to program or not! Today with the tips and programs I'm about to share with you, you will be able to see if your idea is viable by testing it in the real world.

Let's begin!

First, for those who don't know, an MVP in full is basically a Minimal Viable Product/Project. 

This is how Wikipedia defines it: A [**minimum viable product** (**MVP**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future [product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development "New product development").

It has just enough features to be usable by your target customers.

Now, let me show you how you can go about making yours.
