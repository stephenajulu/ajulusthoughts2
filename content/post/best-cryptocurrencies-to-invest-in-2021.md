Hi everyone, so today, I'd like to talk about Crypto. In this post, I'll cover 5 cryptocurrencies that I think you should invest in if you are starting out.

## 1. Bitcoin

## 2. Ethereum

## 3. Dogecoin

## 4. TetherUS

Go check them out, especially with Dogecoin. Implement the HODL technique. This drop and rise so don't be afraid and only invest money you don't mind losing.

To buy these I suggest you try Binance using this link, you'll get **5%:** [**Binance**](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=CL2JFAB6)
