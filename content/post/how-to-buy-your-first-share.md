Hi, how are you? It's been long huh! 

Today I'd like to show you how i bought my first share and how you can too for less than ksh. 200. 

1. First you'll need to get into the right mindset, are you a holder waiting for dividends, are you a semi permanent holder waiting for dividends but once the price shoots up you sell or are you a trader, buying low and selling high almost as fast as a day? Once you identify your category then you can proceed. All the tips below are generalized but i may lean more to my side, the semipermanent. 
2. Research investment platforms. A good idea will be to find one that is registered with the Capital Markets Authority(CMA), has a website with online trading support, has a good customer service, supports M-Pesa(if you are a Kenyan) and has an app for whatever device you use(android or iPhone). Once you find that out, you can proceed, I chose Genghis Capital so I'll be using this down below but you should be able to do the process almost exactly the same. 
3. Registration. Now, you will be required to enter your name, ID, bank details and other personal information. I can't specify because each registration will be different depending with the bank you choose.
