Phones have become a part of our life, we cherish them and most importantly, we take them everywhere, even in toilets ðŸ˜¬.

With phones, comes apps, tons of them and today I'd like to share my 7 best android apps, let's begin.

## 1. [**Simplenote**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.automattic.simplenote&hl=en_US&gl=US) by Automattic

This is not only the best note taking app in my opinion but also my favorite app in my phone overall. With it, I can take quick notes or lists, write markdown and automatically sync notes on all my devices(cross platform).

Now you should know this is no full blown note taking app, it as the name says, it gives you a minimal and simplistic way to write, pin and group notes based on tags.

I use it to jot down ideas, to do lists, blog posts, and more.

## 2. [**Adobe Spark Post**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.spark.post&hl=en_US&gl=US) by Adobe

I run businesses, I build brands, I manage social media accounts and more, Adobe Spark Post has been my partner for a long time, I use it when i need to design a poster or banner super quick and still make it look great.

It has so many themes that can be used to build posters and banners for every occasion, design for the web and social media. All high quality stuf unlike a few i won't mention.

## 3. [**Bitwarden**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&hl=en_US&gl=US) by Bitwarden

My favorite password manager of choice, what more can i say. It's literally the best and i recommend you switch to this if you are using LastPass because of the recent LastPass issue. Helps keep and generate passwords and secret notes.

## 4. [**AZ Screen Recorder**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en_US&gl=US) by AZ Screen Recorder

I build a lot of things and sometimes i need to test how those things look on android. I also do a lot of launches and therefore use AZ Screen Recorder to record the apps and websites for promo videos and more.

## 5. [**MiXplorer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixplorer.silver&hl=en_US&gl=US) by Hootan Parsa

My favorite file manager. 

Here a some of the things it provides: Archiver, SMB2, Image, Tagger, Metadata and PDF

## 6. **Office** by Microsoft Office
