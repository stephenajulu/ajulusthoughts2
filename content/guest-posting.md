## Guest Post For The Noesis

_The Noesis_ covers the ways that technology and science are changing the way we live. Our stories go through a collaborative and thorough editorial process. We try to respond to every pitch, but if you don’t hear back within a few weeks, please follow up or resubmit.

Nothing elevates a strong story like mesmerizing art. That’s why we also work with freelance illustrators to create eye-popping art for our feature stories. Details on how to pitch yourself as an illustrator are below.

Pitches for written work are usually read by the editor in chief. That contact information can be found below.

## What We’re Looking For

* Strong angles for _The Noesis_’s smart audience
* Reported stories that show readers something new, like an unexpected side effect of an app, a new surveillance program, a cutting-edge research program, or a new community or trend
* How technology & science intersect with other fields, including business, health, politics, culture, and more

## What We're NOT Looking For

* Most opinion pieces or personal reactions to news
* Executive op-eds
* Stories someone else has already published

## How To Pitch

A good pitch contains a _story,_ a narrative backbone. Pitches should clearly and concisely convey the story you plan to write and why it matters. The best pitches display promising pre-reporting and a deep knowledge of the topic as well as a sense of the angle or insight you plan to pursue. If your story depends on access to a person or company, you should say whether you have obtained it already (and if not, what your prospects are). Pitches should also be written in the style you expect to write the story.

Good pitches also contain a reporting plan and an estimated word count. Please also link similar stories you’ve done in the past. (It’s more helpful to the editor in chief than a generic portfolio.) Put the pitch in the body of your email, please!

A common mistake when submitting pitches is pitching a _topic_ rather than a _story._ We are looking for stories. For example, a broad overview of CRISPR/Cas9 is less interesting(but allowed)  to us than a scientist’s specific work on a gene variant. Good stories are specific; they live and die on details.

Depending on the focus of your story, it may fall under one of _The Noesis's_ categories: features, tech, science, transportation, film & TV, games, and art. Below are more detailed descriptions of what each of those sections is looking for.

## Features

Our features take the rigorous, forward-looking journalism _The Noesis_ is known for, and combine it with the narrative muscle of classic magazine stories. We’re looking for pieces that are more expansive and accessible than what people may consider within the purview of a tech site.

A great feature pitch for _The Noesis_ does three things: it gives the scope of the narrative, it lays out an ambitious reporting plan, and it shows us that you can write with a strong voice. (A sense of humor never hurts!) Also, there’s no need to send a whole CV — just one or two examples of feature-length pieces you’ve written is all we need.
